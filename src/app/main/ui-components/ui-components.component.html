      <div class="app-productive-heading-02 mb-2">RESPONSIVE GRID</div>
      <div class="app-body-long-02 mb-6">
        Youpez uses the <span class="font-bold">angular-flex</span> library for creating <span class="font-bold">responsive grid layouts</span>.
        This library allows to create layouts without using css 'hacking' with media queries (which are complicated to
        use nowadays because you can't reach css code in your business logic).
        So basically you can handle your responsive operations in your frontend typescript code with basic css class
        modifications depending on the resolution and your unique implementation.

      <div class="app-body-long-01 p-4 app-bg-container mb-10">
        Angular Flex Layout provides a sophisticated layout API using Flexbox CSS + mediaQuery. This module provides
        Angular developers with component layout features using a custom Layout API, mediaQuery observables, and
        injected DOM flexbox-2016 CSS stylings.
        <br/> <br/>
        The Flex Layout engine intelligently automates the process of applying appropriate Flexbox CSS to browser view
        hierarchies. This automation also addresses many of the complexities and workarounds encountered with the
        traditional, manual, CSS-only application of box CSS.
        <br/> <br/>
        The real power of Flex Layout, however, is its responsive engine. The Responsive API enables developers to
        easily specify different layouts, sizing, visibilities for different viewport sizes and display devices.

        Youpez uses <span class="font-bold">Tailwindcss</span> for styling components and for helper classes.
        This allows for very fast development and to focus on unique and creative stuff not on the 'how am i going to do this?'.
